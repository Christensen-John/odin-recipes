      them down to be polite? As it turns out they justs didn't know what they
      were doing. Show up at the next event with these and reteach how to each
      these awesome plants!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any thicker, heartier vegetable of your choice: potatoes, broccoli,
        cauliflower, brussel sprouts
      </li>
      <li>Head of garlic (optional)</li>
      <li>Onion (optional)</li>
      <li>Olive oil, extra virgin is preferred.</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
      <li>Pepper</li>
      <li>Chili (optional)</li>
      <li>
        Also optional, literally any spice mixture you want to make these babies
        pop!
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Pre-heat an oven to 375&deg</li>
      <li>
        Cut your vegatables into bite size pieces. Brussel sprouts in half and
        try to keep them as whole as possible. Don't throw away those stray
        leaves though! Those will crisp up and become the tastiest little
        brussel-sprout-chips that you've ever tasted! If you are roasting a head
        of garlic as well, leave it mostly whole but take a knife and "chop it's
        head off". Slice through the top off so that each of the cloves has been
        cut open through the paper skin.
      </li>
      <li>Quarter the onion</li>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl, place all the vegetables except the garlic. Add
        a tablespoon (ish) of oil and mix to coat all the vegetables.
      </li>
      <li>
        spread all your oiled veggies onto a baking tray, then arrange so
        they're not piled up. If they are too close to one another they will
        steam rather than roast and they won't develop that incredible crunch
        and flavor profile that we are craving! Then make sure to place all
        veggies with a cut surface flat face down! That will increase the
        surface area on the hot pan to make sure they develop a nice crust on
        that face.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the veggies are placed on the pan, nestle the garlic bulb somewhere
        that it fits and drizzle some more olive oil over it so that it pours in
        the creases and crevasses and the clove skins.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place in oven and roast for about 12 minutes. Keep an eye and take out
        at your preferred level of cooked! You can make them darker by leaving
        them in.
      </li>
    </ol>
